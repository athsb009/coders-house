# Room Management Features

## Overview
The Coderhouse Metaverse app now provides comprehensive room management functionality that allows users to create, join, and share custom rooms instead of being automatically placed in rooms.

## Features

### 1. Room Selection Options
When users visit the app, they now see a main menu with four options:

- **Join Public Lobby**: Join the default public room
- **Explore Custom Rooms**: Browse existing custom rooms
- **Create New Room**: Create a new custom room
- **Join Room by ID**: Join a specific room using its ID

### 2. Create Custom Rooms
Users can create custom rooms with:
- **Name**: Required room name
- **Description**: Required room description  
- **Password**: Optional password for private rooms
- **Auto-dispose**: Automatic cleanup when empty

### 3. Room Discovery
The custom rooms table shows:
- Room avatar (generated from room name)
- Room name and description
- Room ID (for sharing)
- Current player count
- Lock icon for password-protected rooms
- Share button to copy room link

### 4. Room Sharing
- **Share Button**: Click to copy room link to clipboard
- **URL Parameters**: Room links work with `?room=ROOM_ID` format
- **Direct Join**: Users with room links are prompted to join automatically

### 5. Room Joining
Multiple ways to join rooms:
- **From URL**: Automatic join prompt when room ID is in URL
- **From Table**: Click join button in custom rooms list
- **Manual Entry**: Use "Join Room by ID" dialog
- **Password Support**: Secure access to private rooms

## Technical Implementation

### URL Handling
```typescript
// Check for room parameter in URL
useEffect(() => {
  const params = new URLSearchParams(location.search)
  const roomIdFromURL = params.get('room')
  if (roomIdFromURL && lobbyJoined) {
    setRoomId(roomIdFromURL)
    setShowJoinRoomDialog(true)
  }
}, [lobbyJoined])
```

### Room Creation
```typescript
// Create custom room
const handleCreateRoom = () => {
  if (lobbyJoined) {
    setShowCreateRoomForm(true)
  } else {
    setShowSnackbar(true)
  }
}
```

### Room Sharing
```typescript
// Share room link
const handleShareRoom = (roomId: string) => {
  const roomUrl = `${window.location.origin}${window.location.pathname}?room=${roomId}`
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(roomUrl)
}
```

## User Flow

1. **Landing Page**: User sees main menu with room options
2. **Create Room**: Fill form with name, description, optional password
3. **Join Room**: Multiple ways to join existing rooms
4. **Share Room**: Copy link to share with others
5. **Direct Access**: Users with room links get automatic join prompt

## Benefits

- **No Auto-Join**: Users choose where to go instead of being forced into rooms
- **Better Organization**: Clear separation between public and custom rooms
- **Easy Sharing**: Simple room link sharing functionality
- **Flexible Access**: Multiple ways to join rooms based on user preference
- **Password Protection**: Secure private rooms with password authentication
